# Planet Simulator

To anyone who wants to test this program,
0. Use SourceCode/MAKEFILE-MS to compile the source code.
1. Download all the contents in <executable> folder.
2. Make sure PlanetSimulator.exe, glut32.dll and texture.raw are in the same folder.
3. Run PlanetSimulator.exe. More specific control explanation is in README.txt.
4. Firewall might alarm you it is a virus or Trojan. Turnoff the firewall or check my code and recompile it.

To anyone who want to review the source code, all files are in the SourceFile folder.

Todo: Lighting.
      More Texture test.
			Stress test with more planets, 
			Testing Multi-camera function.
			!!!!Frame rate control.!!!
			
Update(10/1/2019):
	This project will be abandoned for a while. I am and will be quite busy in studying physics and math in next few years.
